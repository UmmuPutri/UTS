            <h3>Undergraduate at Institute Technologi PLN</h3>
            <p>2022-present</p>
            <p> In my second year of college, Ive improved my 
                understanding of peoples characters and learned how
                to respond to them effectively. I've also developed 
                strong decision-making skills by considering the 
                potential outcomes of my choices. These experiences 
                have enhanced my interpersonal abilities and problem-solving skills.</p>

            <h3>Senior High School at MAN 3</h3>
            <p>2019-2022</p>
            <p>My educational journey, spanning from secondary 
               school to the present, has been marked by active 
               involvement in a variety of extracurricular activities 
               and organizations. These experiences have enhanced 
               my ability to connect with new people, communicate 
               effectively, and be open to different perspectives.</p>

            <h3>Junior High School at Boarding School Al-Kautsar Al-Akbar</h3>
            <p>2016-2019</p>
            <p>while I was at boarding school, I've cultivated the 
               proficiency to fluently communicate in both Arabic 
               and English as my daily languages, reflecting my 
               commitment to embracing global perspectives. Living
               in the dormitory has been a transformative experience,
               fostering independence and reshaping my dependence habits.
               This journey has not only polished my academic skills but
                has also made me adaptable, resilient, and ready to 
                conquer the dynamic world</p>
