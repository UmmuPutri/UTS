            <h2>Some Memorable Photos</h2>
            <h3>"Sunset"</h3>
            <p>Watching the sunset is one of my favorite things to do. 
                Because seeing it makes me happy and calm about the 
                natural gradations that it gives off from the colors 
                that it has. Plus if we see it on the beach, then the 
                beauty looks even more perfect. The waves that sweep 
                across the sand are accompanied by the twilight sky 
                that will fade to the west.</p><br>

            <h3>"GSM"</h3>
            <p>GSM is an organization engaged in teaching or serving
                 children who need education. From GSM I know that
                  there are still many people out there who need more
                   knowledge about history, science, etc. Therefore 
                   GSM was established to be able to help Indonesian 
                   children who still need knowledge, so that they can 
                   also feel what it's like to learn with friends 
                   "knowing anatomy, recognizing letters etc. I am 
                   also more grateful after getting to know the children
                    out there, even though they do not have the funds 
                    for school, but they still have the determination 
                    and enthusiasm in learning. </p><br>

            <h3>"Malang"</h3>
            <p>I love traveling. Malang is one of the places I visited,
                 Malang is one of the cities that has many tourist
                  attractions, one of which is Bromo. When I went to
                   Bromo I was unlucky, because it was cloudy, therefore
                    I could not see the sunrise from the top of Mount
                     Bromo, it was very unfortunate.</p><br>
